## When a user goes to the /pokemon route they will see an index of pokemon: the names of each pokemon rendered to the page.

## When a user clicks on the name of the pokemon, they will be taken to that pokemon's show page, and will see the pokemon's name and image.

## When a user goes to /pokemon/new a user sees a form that allows them to create a brand new pokemon, and then redirects the user back to /pokemon
